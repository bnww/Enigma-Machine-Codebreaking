# Simulation of the Enigma Machine

## Description
The Enigma machine was a cipher machine used during World War II for secure communication. It consisted of a series of rotating disks, known as rotors, which would scramble the input message. The scrambled message would then be transmitted and decrypted at the receiving end using the same machine settings. The Enigma machine played a significant role in the history of cryptography and was famously cracked by the efforts of codebreakers at Bletchley Park, including Alan Turing.
