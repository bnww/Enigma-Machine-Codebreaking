# Simulation of the Enigma Machine

## Description
This is a repository of code written for the Principles of Programming module of my University of Bath Artifical Intelligence MSc.

It involved creating a full simulation of the enigma machine, and then using this to crack some codes.

`enigma.py` is the simulation of the enigma machine.

`enigma_assignment.ipynb` includes assignment instructions. This explains the inner workings of the enigma machine. Includes tests to see whether the simulation gives the correct output for various enigma settings. Also includes a series of codebreaking challenges.

`CodeBreaking.ipynb` consists of a
