# Simulation of the Enigma Machine

## Description
This is a repository of code written for the Principles of Programming module of my University of Bath Artifical Intelligence MSc.

`enigma.py` is the simulation of the enigma machine.

`enigma_demo.ipynb` is a demo notebook and assignment instructions.

`CodeBreaking.ipynb` consists of a series of codebreaking
